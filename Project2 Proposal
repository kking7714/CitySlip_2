City Slip 2
Team: Miriam, Kris, Nathan

Description:

This project updates our Project 1 City Slip. For a particular zip code, provide a score (0-100) based on our specific
criteria, which include (but not limited to): population growth, number of schools, housing/rent prices, plus interesting
facts such as the number of parks and restaurants, average weather and more.

All the graphs will be recreated using D3 and related libraries, including Leaflet. The graphs will be interactive.
Results will be stored in a sqlite database. Some data will be plotted on a US map.
